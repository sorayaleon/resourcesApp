# React Resource App

Project created in react in which I have made a small CRUD for the management of web resources. This is a project for learning purposes.


## Technologies
- Reactjs: to perform a basic CRUD.
- Firebase: as backend and database.
- Bulma: for styles. I have left the default styles that the framework brings, since the objective was to learn Reactjs.

In order to start the project you must configure the .env file with the firebase environment variables.


## npm:

#### Libraries setup and configuration

```bash
$npm install
```

#### Development mode

```bash
$npm start
```
